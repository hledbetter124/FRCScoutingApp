# FRCScoutingApp
Python/Android application for Scouting at first robotics competitions. 
This was probably an hours worth of boredom at school so don't judge the terrible styling. 

Instructions:
it's a python script so really all you need to know is it requires openpyxl, pydrive, and tkinter (pip3 install $PACKAGEE_NAME)

If you're on android and want a .apk that's coming soon, nothing upto release 0.2 works, and we'll see if I get around to fixing it before the competition. 

Good Luck and lmk if I messed up

Update: The pitscouting program is for when you go around and ask people questions, and the main one if for watching matches, I figured it was better to have seperate scripts
