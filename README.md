# FRCScoutingApp
Python/Android application for Scouting at first robotics competitions. 
This was probably an hours worth of boredom at school so don't judge the terrible styling. 

Instructions:
it's a python script so really all you need to know is it requires openpyxl (pip3 install openpyxl)

If you're on android and want a .apk that's coming soon or maybe it's already up- I doubt I'll remember
to update this. 

Good Luck and lmk if I messed up
