# FRCScoutingApp

**Brought to you by Team 5176- The Robobills**


Python/Android application for Scouting at first robotics competitions. 
This was probably an hours worth of boredom at school so don't judge the terrible styling. 

Instructions:
requires openpyxl, pydrive, and tkinter (pip3 install $PACKAGEE_NAME)

In order for google drive to work you have to create an oauth key and put the client_secrets.json in the root directory of the program. Everything else works fine without this.

If you're on android and want a .apk that's coming soon, nothing upto release 0.2 works, and we'll see if I get around to fixing it before the competition. 

Good Luck and lmk if I messed up

Update: The pitscouting program is for when you go around and ask people questions, and the main one if for watching matches, I figured it was better to have seperate scripts
